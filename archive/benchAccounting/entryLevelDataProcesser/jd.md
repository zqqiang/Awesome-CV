We're a passionate and fun group of people working hard to bring financial mastery to 1,000,000 people. For many small business owners, keeping up to date on their books means less time spent growing their businesses. Bench solves this dilemma by taking bookkeeping off of our clients hands. We’ve paired our intuitive (and quite beautiful) software with a team of dedicated bookkeepers to provide monthly bookkeeping at an accessible price, giving entrepreneurs the time and the confidence to run the businesses they love.

Bench is post Series B, capitalized by a team of Silicon Valley and New York investors. We’re scaling fast and we’re not slowing down anytime soon. In just a few short years, we’ve grown from four co-founders to over 350 Benchmates. We’re looking for the brightest minds to join us on this incredible journey, in pursuit of bringing financial mastery to our clients.
