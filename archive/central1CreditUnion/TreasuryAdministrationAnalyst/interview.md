# Interview Questions

1. Tell me about your past experiences in your previous job.

1. Tell me what you know about the credit union system.

A credit union is a member-owned financial cooperative, controlled by its members and operated on the principle of people helping people, providing its members credit at competitive rates as well as other financial services.

Worldwide, credit union systems vary significantly in terms of total assets and average institution asset size, ranging from volunteer operations with a handful of members to institutions with assets worth several billion U.S. dollars and hundreds of thousands of members.[3] Credit unions operate alongside other mutuals and cooperatives engaging in cooperative banking, such as building societies.

"Natural-person credit unions" (also called "retail credit unions" or "consumer credit unions") serve individuals, as distinguished from "corporate credit unions", which serve other credit unions.[4][5][6]

Credit unions in the US had one-fifth the failure rate of other banks during the financial crisis of 2007–2008[7] and more than doubled lending to small businesses between 2008 and 2016, from $30 billion to $60 billion, while lending to small businesses overall during the same period declined by around \$100 billion.[8] Public trust in credit unions stands at 60%, compared to 30% for big banks.[9] Furthermore, small businesses are eighty percent less likely to be dissatisfied with a credit union than with a big bank.

1. What are you looking for by applying for this position?

I'm looking for a position where I can have the opportunity to use my xxx skills. As a xxx at your company, I would be able to apply my years of experience as a successful xxx and would be able to xxxx I most enjoy working on.

1. If there is a conflict between you and your colleagues, what will you do?

For example, “I always take the person aside and discuss the issue privately. I listen actively to make sure I understand the other person’s point of view, and I work with the person to develop a solution together.” Stress that even if you both don’t completely agree on the end result, you tried to at least meet each other halfway.

Pro tip: “Don’t nonverbally communicate resentment when telling a story,” Kelley advises. “Aggressive body language and tone of voice can show that you harbor bad feelings.”

1. Why do I want to work at central 1?

Company general reputation
Reputation of key leaders
Admiration of products/services
Admiration of other company initiatives (marketing campaign, community involvement, training programs)
Company culture and values
Company growth/success

1. Tell me about a time when you had an issue with a co-worker.

“Focus on the facts instead of blaming the other person,” Kelley says. Rather than saying, “Jim was such a slacker,” simply explain the situation and what steps you took to solve the problem—“On at least three occasions, Jim missed deadlines that pushed back our production schedule. After I discussed this with him, we found a way to improve the workflow system together.”

1. Tell me about a time when you disagreed with your boss.

To set a positive tone, begin your response by acknowledging the difficulty of the situation—“It’s not easy to confront your manager, but I’ve learned that it has to be done some times.” Then choose an anecdote that shows you respected your boss’ opinion—“When my boss suggested we change our sales pitch to new clients, we figured out what wasn’t working and created a new strategy together.”

1. How do you deal with differences of opinion when working on a team?

“Employers want to hear that you value diversity of opinion,” Kelley explains, “and that you realize different opinions can contribute to a better solution than if everyone just immediately agreed with each other.”

As such, your response to this question should point out that you welcome alternate perspectives—“I always appreciate different viewpoints from my own. When someone expresses a different opinion, I listen carefully to what the person says and utilize that feedback.”

1. Tell me about a time you had to respond to an unhappy customer or client.

“How you respond to conflicts with a customer is a public matter, and it can cost the company a lot of money if you lose a major client or customer,” Kelley says. “[Show] that you’re willing to jump through extra hoops to make customers or clients happy.” This demonstrates that you understand the value of customer service. As with other behavioral interview questions, your anecdote should focus on the positive outcome—“Here was how I de-escalated the situation and kept the client happy going forward.”

Show hiring managers that you aren’t nursing an overblown ego and are eager to embrace a peacekeeping process. Not only can this type of attitude serve you well in the workplace, but it can also improve non-working relationships as well.
